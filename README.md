# python-api-challenge
For this challenge I relied heavily on the activities from Module 6 of class, as well as tutoring sessions, and the Ask the Class slack channel. Kourt Bailey helped me with determining how to do the WeatherPy portion of the homework -- specifically the code for looping through all of the cities and pulling information from the open weather api. I also learned that the starter code steered me wrong by having a "bare" except. I looked back at my pandas challenge to figure out how to do the linear regression work for this challenge, as well as using Stack Overflow. The Vacation portion of the challenge was pretty straightforward. I used what we learned in the class for 6.3 to create my maps. I had to look at the activities we didn't get to in 6.3 to figure out how to make the map hovers show the hotel names and country names as well. Once I looked at the solved code from that class it made sense and worked well.
